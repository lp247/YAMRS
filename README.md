Yet another movie rating site

## About the project
This project is a challenge to be done in a few days. It is asked to develop a movie rating website with the following requirements (quoted from the original coding_challenge.md file):
> Coding Challenge Guidelines
> ===========================
> 
> Please organize, design, test, document and deploy your code as if it were
> going into production, then send us a link to the hosted repository (e.g.
> Github, Bitbucket...).
> 
> Functional spec
> ---------------
> 
> Prototype the following project:
> 
> 
> ### Movie Reviews
> 
> 
> Create an app that publicly lists paginated movie reviews. Atleast this basic info should be shown: movie title, nickname/fullname of user who submited review, review text, review stars given
> The app should allow non-authenticated users to submit movie reviews (text + star selection).
> Once a movie review is submited a simple email should be sent to "admin" users. 
> The email should contain a link to "protected" page where admins can approve + (possibly correct) or reject the review. Once the review gets approved, it should appear on the public review list page.
> 
> 
> Please use any 3rd-party API services that you deem necessary, i.e:
> 
> * [The Movie Db](https://www.themoviedb.org) 
> 
> Most of the 3rd-party api services have free/freemium plans.
> Please register your own test accounts on each.
> 
> 
> 
> Technical spec
> --------------
> 
> The architecture will be split between a back-end and a web front-end so full-stack. 
> Use **GraphQL** as your API communication "protocol".
> Use **Typescript** for any javascript related parts.
> 
> ### Back-end
> 
> In General we believe there is no one-size-fits-all technology. Good engineering is about
> using the right tools and libraries for the right job, and constantly learning about them.
> Therefore, feel free to mention in your `README` how much experience you have
> with the technical stack / libraries you choose, we will take note of that when reviewing
> your challenge.
> 
> Since this is a specific case, we would like you to use one of the following languages:
> 
> * Node.js (typescript) 
> * Go
> 
> Any of the following dabtabases:
> 
> * mysql
> * postgresql
> * mongodb
> * other - describe in your README why it was chosen. 
> 
> You are also free to use any web framework or library. If you choose to use a framework
> that results in boilerplate code in the repository, please detail in your
> README which code was written by you (as opposed to generated code).
> 
> ### Front-end
> 
> The front-end should use React (with typescript) ideally be a single page app (where applicable)
> 
> You are also free to use any web framework or library. If you choose to use a framework
> that results in boilerplate code in the repository, please detail in your
> README which code was written by you (as opposed to generated code).
> 
> Host it!
> --------
> When youâ€™re done, host it somewhere (e.g. on Amazon EC2, Heroku, Google AppEngine, Zeit Now, etc.).
